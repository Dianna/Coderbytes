//This code does not work in all cases

/* Have the function DivisionStringified(num1,num2) take both parameters being passed, 
divide num1 by num2, and return the result as a string with properly formatted commas. If 
an answer is only 3 digits long, return the number with no commas (ie. 2 / 3 should output 
"1"). For example: if num1 is 123456789 and num2 is 10000 the output should be "12,345". */

function DivisionStringified(num1,num2) { 
  var solution = Math.round(num1/num2).toString().split("");//now an array
  var commaPlacer = -3; //index to put comma
  while(solution.length+commaPlacer>0){ //check that >3 & not in front
    solution.splice(commaPlacer,0,",");
    commaPlacer = -4;
  }
